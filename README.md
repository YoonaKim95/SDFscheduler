Design a scheduling algorithm, please refer to the attached zip file. The zip file includes

(1) input topology xml file. It contains the execution time information of nodes and the throughput constraint.

(2) The scheduling objective is to minimize the resources (number of processors and buffers) while satisfying the throughput constraint.

(3) XXX_schedule.xml is the scheduling output result. You may generate another form of output if it shows the scheduline information fully.

There are two zip files. The first one contains two acyclic SDF graph, and the second one contains one cyclic SDF graph (complex one). 

Since the scheduling result is obtained from a meta-heuristic algorithm, your heuristic may give worse results that the provided one. That is O.K. Competition will be made among the teams that are involved in the competition.
